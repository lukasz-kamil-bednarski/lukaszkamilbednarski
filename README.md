Hello! 👋 
My name is Łukasz and I am a Java Software Engineer.

I have several years of experience in development of BE applications & systems in Java (basically in JVM stack area).

I used to work at every stage of software production, both designing the architecture, developing software, automatic tests and continuous integration & deployment to the target environments.

I apply agile methodologies in my work.
